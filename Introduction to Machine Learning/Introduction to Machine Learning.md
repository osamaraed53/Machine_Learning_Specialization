Machine Learning : Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel 1959)  

Machine Learning algorithms :
- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning


## Supervised learning
> refer to algorithms that learn X-to-Y, or input-to-Output, mappings, Learn from data ~={blue}labeled=~ with the ~={red}right answers=~

the key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from that include the ~={red}right answers=~ where by right answer, I mean the correct label Y for a given input X

Types :
	- Classification
	- Regression

classification :  ~={orange}predict categories=~, is that classification predicts a small, ~={yellow}finite=~, limited set of possible output categories such as 0, 1 and 2 but not all possible numbers in between like 0,5 or 0,7 (predict categories small number of possible outputs)

Regression : ~={orange}predict a number=~ ~={yellow}infinitely=~ many possible outputs

## ~={red}Un=~supervised learning
> Data only comes with inputs x, but nut output labels y. Algorithm has to find ~={cyan}structure=~ in the data  Find something interesting in ~={blue}unlabeled data=~.

Types:
	- Clustering 
	- Anomaly detection
	- Dimensionality reduction 


Clustering : Group similar data points together. 

Anomaly detection: Find manual data points.

Dimensionality reduction : Compress data using fewer number.
